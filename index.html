<h1>{{ page.Title }}</h1>

<p>Each year betwen 2010 and 2016, Bristol CND asked young people aged 12-18 to show us, in a film or vlog 30–120 seconds long "What would you tell the world about nuclear weapons?".</p>

            <h3>We asked them to think about:</h3>
            <dl>
                <dt class="text-danger">The cost:</dt>
                <dd>200,000 died at Hiroshima and Nagasaki</dd>
                <dt class="text-danger">The risk:</dt>
                <dd>Human error has repeatedly put us within minutes of a first strike</dd>
                <dt class="text-danger">The scale:</dt>
                <dd>There are over 23,000 nuclear warheads in the world</dd>
                <dt class="text-danger">The price:</dt>
                <dd>£205 billion for a Trident replacement over its lifetime</dd>

            <h3><span class="text-danger">Why</span> &#034;CHANCE of a Lifetime&#034;</h3>
            <p>
               The number of nuclear weapons in the world is now 75% less than in 1986 &ndash; it can be done!
               In the UK, in the age of austerity, all parties are questioning spending &pound;205 billion on replacing Trident.
               Now we have the chance to lead the world and get rid of our immoral nuclear weapons.

            <h3><span class="text-danger">Not</span> &#034;A Lifetime of Chance&#034;</h3>
            <p>
                Just take a look at what happened when we used
                nuclear weapons at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki"  target="_blank">Hiroshima and Ngasaki</a> and
                you&#039;ll know why not. Since 1945, fear of nuclear war
                has cast a shadow over the world, fear that it may
                happen by accident, fear as more fingers hover over
                more buttons that can unleash Armageddon. And the
                more we depend on them and spend on them, the
                more other countries will want to have their own. It
                has to stop and <a href="http://www.cnduk.org/" target="_blank">CND</a> has been campaigning for over
                50 years for global abolition of nuclear weapons.
